If you're anything like me, you probably find yourself repeatedly looking up the same commands you've forgotten. "Keep" is an open source tool that offers a seamless solution for saving and retrieving commonly used commands right from your terminal. Here's a closer look at why "Keep" is becoming an essential tool for developers and IT professionals.

### Open Source Flexibility

One of the primary reasons to use "Keep" is its open-source nature. Being open source means anyone can contribute to its development, enhancing its features and usability. Users can review the code to ensure it meets their standards for security and efficiency, and even tailor the tool to better suit their needs.

### Export Commands Easily

"Keep" stores all your saved commands in a `commands.json` file located in the `~/.keep/` directory. This feature is particularly useful for those who work across multiple machines or need to share commands with teammates. You can easily export your commands and import them into another instance of "Keep" on a different machine, ensuring you always have your most-used commands at hand.

### Enhanced Functionality with Branch Support

My personal edit to the "Keep" project is a branch that supports running commands directly using their ID ([https://github.com/rushic24/keep](https://github.com/rushic24/keep)). This enhancement simplifies the process of using saved commands. Instead of scrolling through a list or trying to remember a specific command, you can run it directly if you know its ID. This is a significant time-saver, especially when dealing with a large library of commands.

### Adding Commands Made Simple

Adding new commands to "Keep" is as easy as using the command `keep new`. This simplicity encourages users to continually expand their library of commands without hassle, making "Keep" a growing resource that adapts to your needs.

### Conclusion

"Keep" stands out as a practical, user-friendly tool that enhances productivity and efficiency by managing command line instructions seamlessly. Its open-source nature, coupled with the ability to easily export and import commands, as well as the functionality to run them by ID, makes "Keep" a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.
